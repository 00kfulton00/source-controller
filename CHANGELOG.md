# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## 0.0.1-alpha.2 (2020-04-24)

This is the second alpha release of source controller.

It introduces a timeout field to the [`GitRepositoriesSpec`](docs/spec/v1alpha1/gitrepositories.md)
and [`SyncAt` annotation to the common spec](docs/spec/v1alpha1/common.md#source-synchronization).
Furthermore, it allows configuring the amount of concurrent reconciliation
operations per reconciler using the newly introduced `--concurrent` flag
(defaults to `2`), and introduces a `--log-json` flag to enable JSON logging.

Liveness and readiness probes have been added to the deployment manifest, and
the security has been strengthened by running the controller as a non-root user
by default and adding a container security context. 

Tests have been added to ensure correct behaviour of the `HelmChartReconciler`
and `HelmRepositoryReconciler`.

## 0.0.1-alpha.1 (2020-04-16)

This is the first alpha release of source controller.
The controller is an implementation of the
[source.fluxcd.io/v1alpha1](https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller/tree/master/docs/spec/v1alpha1) API
based on the specifications described in the
[Source Controller Proposal](https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller/tree/master/docs/spec).
